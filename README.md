# Music Assistant Kmp Client

Music Assistant Kmp Client is a cross-platform client application designed for Android, iOS, and Java runtime environments. Developed using Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and Compose Multiplatform frameworks, this project aims to provide a unified codebase for seamless music management across multiple platforms.

This client interfaces with the [Music Assistant Server](https://github.com/music-assistant/server), an open-source media library manager that integrates with various streaming services and connected speakers. The server acts as the core component, running on devices like Raspberry Pi, NAS, or Intel NUC, and facilitates centralized music management.

By leveraging the capabilities of KMP and Compose Multiplatform, Music Assistant Kmp Client offers a consistent and efficient user experience across different platforms, simplifying the development process and ensuring feature parity.

## The project is on early stage of development. Any help (especially from designers and iOS developers) is appreciated.
